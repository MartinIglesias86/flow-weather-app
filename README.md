# ✨ Weather App using [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/)

This project is a weather app that shows the current weather and the 5 day forecast for a city.
If you choose a city from the drop-down menu it will show you the information from that city, but by default or if you don't pick an option from the drop-down, it will show the info based on geo-location if you authorize it, if you don't it will show the information from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

 
# Disclosure

Fully knowing that it shouldn't be done this way, but thinking in a practical way to present the challenge, the environmental variables and the .env file
are going to be on the project repository. In a real project that data would not be accesible to the client.
